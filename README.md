## process

### Commit 1: Initial commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Base Files
Added base files for the project. 

### Commit 3: Set-up
Installed moment through npm. Next: the current date showing at the top.

### Commit 4: Current Date
The current date now shows at the top of the page. Next: creating the timeblocks for standard business hours. 

### Commit 5: First timeblock
First to decide how to make them look. I'm thinking each hour will be it's own row. Then each row will be split into 3 columns. The time, the writeable area, and then the save button. I'll make the one for 9am and then commit before making the others. It doesn't look pretty, but I'm going to leave the aesthetics until after I have the functionality down. 

### Commit 6: Rest of the timeblocks
Simply repeated step 5 for the remaining hours. Next: the time relative colors!

### Commit 7: Script Fix
The current date disappeared and I can't figure out why. It's really upsetting me. UPDATE: I have fixed it. For some reason I moved my script above the others, which I now realize no longer lets it reference the other scripts. Also got rid of the node stuff because while checking the slack for help, I realized moment was already linked, and that what I was doing was excessive.
